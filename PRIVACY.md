# Privacy Policy for ConsoleApp

**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

Thank you for using ConsoleApp ("the Add-in"), a Revit add-in designed for developers. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information the Add-in collects and how it is used.

## 1. Information We Collect (and What We Don't)

This Add-in is a local developer utility. It is **not** designed to collect, store, or transmit any personal data, project data, or model information.

### What We DO Store (Locally Only):

To improve your experience, the Add-in saves two small pieces of configuration data **only on your local computer**:

1.  **Theme Preference:** A single `true/false` value (`IsDarkTheme`) is saved in your user settings file (`user.config`) within your local Revit profile folder. This is used only to remember whether you prefer the light or dark theme for the console window.
2.  **Keyboard Shortcut:** The Add-in may write to your local `KeyboardShortcuts.xml` file one time. It does this only to assign the "CW" shortcut for the console, and only if you have not already assigned a shortcut to this command.

### What We DO NOT Collect:

* **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information (such as your name, email, or company).
* **No Model or Project Data:** The Add-in does not read, access, store, or transmit any of your Revit project data, geometry, parameters, or any information contained within your models.
* **No Console Logs:** The console logs intercepted by the Add-in are displayed in real-time for your debugging convenience. They are **not** saved to disk, logged, or transmitted anywhere by the Add-in. They are discarded when the console is cleared or Revit is closed.
* **No Usage Analytics:** The Add-in does not contain any tracking code, telemetry, or analytics to monitor how you use it.

## 2. How We Use Information

The two pieces of configuration data mentioned above are used **solely** for the following functions:
* To load your preferred Light/Dark theme when the console opens.
* To provide you with a convenient "CW" keyboard shortcut.

**No data of any kind is ever sent off your computer by this Add-in.**

## 3. Data Storage and Sharing

* **Storage:** All data is stored locally in your `%APPDATA%` folder as part of your standard Revit user profile.
* **Sharing:** We do not share any information with any third party, as we do not collect any information to begin with.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
