This add-in provides a dockable WPF pane inside Revit. It automatically captures all standard output (`Console.WriteLine`) and standard error (`Console.Error.WriteLine`) streams from any loaded add-in. This allows you to debug your add-ins in real-time without needing to attach a debugger or write to external log files.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Real-time Interception:** Automatically captures all `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Error.WriteLine()` streams.
* **Dockable WPF Pane:** A clean, modern UI that docks anywhere in your Revit workspace.
* **Theme Aware:** Automatically detects and switches between Revit's Light and Dark themes based on your settings.
* **Auto-Shortcut:** Automatically assigns the `CW` keyboard shortcut on first launch (if available) for quick access.
* **Built-in Context Menu:** Includes "Clear", "Copy", and "Select All" for easy log management.

## ðŸ’» Building from Source

This project is configured to multi-target several Revit versions.
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `ConsoleApp.sln` in Visual Studio.
3.  Ensure your Revit API DLLs (`RevitAPI.dll`, `RevitAPIUI.dll`) are correctly referenced.
4.  Select your desired build configuration (e.g., `RL2025` for Release Revit 2025).
5.  Build the project. The Post-Build event will automatically copy the necessary files to your `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins` folder for testing.
